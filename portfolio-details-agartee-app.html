              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>As the sole designer for this project, my contributions encompassed all aspects of the design process,
                from initial research and information architecture to UI design and interaction design. I collaborated
                closely with the product manager to refine the project scope and maintained consistent communication
                with stakeholders throughout the development lifecycle.</p>

              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>This project delivered an application for managing patient health data at Agartee Technology,
                enhancing patient safety and care coordination across their network of over 40 Ontario nursing homes.
                The application provides authorized personnel with secure, real-time access to comprehensive patient
                health data via a user-friendly interface.</p>

              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>The core problem was the absence of a reliable and efficient system providing authorized personnel
                (nurses, pharmacists, etc.) with real-time, accurate, and precise access to patient health data for
                timely and informed decision-making within Agartee Technology's network of nursing homes.</p>

              <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Nurse Interview Difficulties:</strong> Ineffective initial interview methods hindered the
                  accurate gathering of nurse requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Data Accuracy:</strong> Ensuring the accuracy and real-time availability of
                  patient health data presented a significant challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>System Integration:</strong> Achieving seamless integration with existing nursing home
                  infrastructure and workflows was crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Justification:</strong> Demonstrating a clear return on investment (ROI) to buyers was
                  essential.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> Aligning the needs of all stakeholders throughout
                  development required careful coordination.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Solutions</h2>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Improved Interview Techniques:</strong> Implementing more effective interview methods led to
                  a better understanding of nurse needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Robust Data Architecture:</strong> A secure and scalable system ensured accurate, real-time
                  data access.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Friendly Design:</strong> An intuitive interface facilitated easy adoption and usage
                  among end-users.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Training & Support:</strong> Providing thorough training and ongoing support
                  ensured user success.</li>
              </ol>

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <h6>This section details the user-centered research conducted to inform the design and development of the
            Agartee patient data management application, employing a <strong>design thinking approach</strong> to deeply
            understand user needs and iteratively refine the solution. The research aimed to address the core challenge
            of providing
            authorized personnel with real-time, accurate access to patient health data for improved care coordination
            and decision-making.</h6>
        </div>

        <div class="row" data-aos="fade-up">
          <div class="portfolio-description">
            <h2>1. Research Objectives:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Understand User Needs:</strong> Identify the specific needs, workflows, and pain points of key
                user groups, including nurses, buyers, pharmacists, and distributors.</li>
              <li><strong>Enhance Data Collection: </strong>Discover opportunities to automate data collection processes
                and improve data accuracy.</li>
              <li><strong>Design for Security and Efficiency: </strong>Ensure that the system’s design supports secure
                and efficient access to patient data for authorized personnel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Research Methodology:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Semi-structured Interviews:</strong> Open-ended interviews were conducted with representatives
                from each user group (nurses, buyers, pharmacists, distributors). Each interview lasted 30-60 minutes
                and was audio-recorded for detailed analysis. The focus was on exploring user experiences, workflows,
                and pain points related to existing systems and data access.</li>
              <li><strong>Surveys & Questionnaires:</strong> Surveys were administered to buyers, pharmacists, and
                distributors to gather
                quantitative data on their priorities and preferences. Initial attempts to survey nurses yielded mixed
                results, leading to a shift towards observational research for this user group.</li>
              <li><strong>Observational Research:</strong> Direct observation of nurses in their work environment
                provided valuable insights
                into their daily workflows, challenges, and interactions with existing patient data systems. This proved
                crucial in understanding the practical realities of data access and integration within the nursing home
                setting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. User Segmentation & Personas:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Buyers: </strong> Decision-makers responsible for purchasing and implementing the system. Key
                concerns included cost, ROI, and system integration.</li>
              <li><strong>Nurses:</strong> Primary users responsible for direct patient care. Their needs centered on
                ease of use, real-time data access, and seamless integration with existing workflows.</li>
              <li><strong>Pharmacists:</strong> Responsible for managing medication records. Their primary need was
                accurate and readily accessible medication data.</li>
              <li><strong>Distributors:</strong> Responsible for ensuring the reliable availability and functionality of
                the devices. Their focus was on supply chain management and technical support.</li>
            </ul>

                <h6>In our continuous effort to enhance the user experience within the Agartee Patient Data Management
                  app,
                  I made a significant discovery regarding the accessibility of our design elements. During a thorough
                  review of the current color scheme, we found that the text color used within our buttons, set at
                  #FFFFFF (white), did not provide adequate contrast against the button background for all users,
                  particularly those with visual impairments.
                </h6>

                <h2>Importance of Accessibility:</h2>
                <h6>Accessibility is crucial in design, ensuring that all users, regardless of their visual abilities,
                  can effectively engage with our application. High contrast between text and background colors is
                  essential for readability and comprehension. According to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines),
                  a contrast ratio of at least <strong>4.5:1</strong> is recommended for normal text to ensure
                  legibility for users with visual disabilities.</h6>

                <h2>Benefits of the Change:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> The darker text color will provide a clear distinction
                    against the button background, making it easier for users to read and understand button labels.</li>
                  <li><strong>Enhanced User Experience: </strong> By ensuring that all interactive elements are
                    accessible, we create a more inclusive environment that fosters user confidence and satisfaction.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Compliance with Accessibility Standards: </strong>This change aligns with accessibility
                    best practices and demonstrates our commitment to creating an equitable user experience for all
                    healthcare providers.</li>
