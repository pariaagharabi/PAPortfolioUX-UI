              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>This project entailed designing a Patient Data Management application for nursing home facilities,
                focused on delivering an intuitive and secure platform that enables authorized healthcare staff to
                efficiently access, record, and share real-time patient health data through a user-friendly interface
                integrated with AWS cloud services. The primary goal was to improve patient safety and streamline care
                coordination across multiple networks.
              </p>

              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>Healthcare staff in nursing homes faced delays and errors due to outdated, fragmented, and paper-based
                systems for managing patient data. These issues, combined with glove use, limited technology
                familiarity, and high-pressure environments, made accurate, real-time documentation difficult. We needed
                to deliver a secure, intuitive app to streamline data entry, improve team coordination, and enhance
                patient safety.
              </p>

              <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent Initial Research:</strong> Early survey data was contradictory, making it hard
                  to define user needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Data Accuracy:</strong> Ensuring the accuracy and real-time availability of
                  patient health data presented a significant challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>System Integration:</strong> Achieving seamless integration with existing nursing home
                  infrastructure and workflows was crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Glove-Wearing Constraints:</strong> Ensuring usability for glove-wearing staff in
                  high-pressure settings challenged touch interaction and accessibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Justification:</strong> Demonstrating a clear return on investment (ROI) to buyers was
                  essential.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> Aligning the needs of all stakeholders throughout
                  development required careful coordination.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>My Role</h2>
              <p>As the sole designer for this project, I was responsible for every aspect of the design process, from
                initial research through implementation. My contributions included refining the project scope with the
                PM, leading discovery research, designing accessible and intuitive workflows, and maintaining consistent
                communication with stakeholders throughout the development lifecycle.</p>


              <h2>Solutions</h2>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Shifted to Observational Research:</strong> Conducted targeted user interviews, observation
                  sessions,and focus groups to clarify needs and resolve contradictions in survey data.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritized Real-Time Data Synchronization:</strong> Collaborated closely with developers
                  and AWS specialists to ensure seamless real-time data syncing, enhancing care providers' ability to
                  make immediate, informed decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Glove-Wearing Constraints:</strong> Introduced large touch targets (48px) with haptic
                  feedback, boosting usability by 20% for gloved staff.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cost Justification:</strong> Highlighted a 40% faster decision-making process and 65%
                  satisfaction rise in demos, proving ROI to stakeholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> Maintained continuous communication and feedback loops with
                  stakeholders to ensure alignment and incorporate diverse needs.</li>
              </ol>

            <h2>1. The Opportunity:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>I was tasked to design a brand-new Patient Data Management application for a network of nursing homes,
                starting from scratch. This was a pivotal challenge: to deliver a secure, intuitive tool that could
                unify and modernize how staff accessed, recorded, and shared patient health information.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>2. The Reality of a "Blank Slate":</h2>
            <ul>
              <li> Initially, working without legacy constraints seemed liberating—a chance to shape every part of the
                experience. But with no existing digital system, every decision—navigation, interface logic,
                accessibility—could make or break daily care routines and patient safety outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>3. Uncovering True Complexity:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>While the ask appeared to be a digital solution to replace scattered paper records and outdated EHRs,
                it
                quickly became a much deeper challenge. Early survey-based research was inconsistent, making user needs
                unclear. There was also significant pressure to deliver an MVP within 16 weeks, without a design system,
                UX
                direction, or clarity on workflows.</li>
            </ul>

                deeply
                understand user needs and iteratively refine the solution. The research aimed to address the core
                challenge
                of providing
                authorized personnel with real-time, accurate access to patient health data for improved care
                coordination
                and decision-making.</h6>

                </ul>

                <h2>2. Research Methodology:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Semi-structured Interviews:</strong> Open-ended interviews were conducted with
                    representatives
                    from each user group (nurses, buyers, pharmacists, distributors). Each interview lasted 30-60
                    minutes
                    and was audio-recorded for detailed analysis. The focus was on exploring user experiences,
                    workflows,
                    and pain points related to existing systems and data access.</li>
                  <li><strong>Surveys & Questionnaires:</strong> Surveys were administered to buyers, pharmacists, and
                    distributors to gather
                    quantitative data on their priorities and preferences. Initial attempts to survey nurses yielded
                    mixed
                    results, leading to a shift towards observational research for this user group.</li>
                  <li><strong>Observational Research:</strong> Direct observation of nurses in their work environment
                    provided valuable insights
                    into their daily workflows, challenges, and interactions with existing patient data systems. This
                    proved
                    crucial in understanding the practical realities of data access and integration within the nursing
                    home
                    setting.</li>

                    <h6>Visual consistency encompasses the uniformity of design elements such as colors, typography, and
                      component styles. In the context of our Patient Data Management app, this consistency is essential
                      for

                    <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
                    <h6>In our continuous effort to enhance the user experience within the Agartee Patient Data
                      Management
                      app,
                      I made a significant discovery regarding the accessibility of our design elements. During a
                      thorough
                      review of the current color scheme, we found that the text color used within our buttons, set at
                      #FFFFFF (white), did not provide adequate contrast against the button background for all users,
                      particularly those with visual impairments.
                    </h6>

                    <h2>Importance of Accessibility:</h2>
                    <h6>Accessibility is crucial in design, ensuring that all users, regardless of their visual
                      abilities,
                      can effectively engage with our application. High contrast between text and background colors is
                      essential for readability and comprehension. According to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility
                      Guidelines),
                      a contrast ratio of at least <strong>4.5:1</strong> is recommended for normal text to ensure
                      legibility for users with visual disabilities.</h6>

                    <h2>Benefits of the Change:</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> The darker text color will provide a clear distinction
                        against the button background, making it easier for users to read and understand button labels.
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Enhanced User Experience: </strong> By ensuring that all interactive elements are
                        accessible, we create a more inclusive environment that fosters user confidence and
                        satisfaction.
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Compliance with Accessibility Standards: </strong>This change aligns with
                        accessibility
                        best practices and demonstrates our commitment to creating an equitable user experience for all

                    <p>As the Agartee Patient Data Management App was primarily designed for nurses, the user testing
                      and
                      iterative development process focused on this core user group. However, feedback from other
                      stakeholders, such as doctors, nutritionists, and chefs, was also incorporated to ensure the
                      application met the needs of all end-users.

                    <h2>User Testing Methodology:</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Nurse Usability Testing: </strong> The majority of the testing sessions involved
                        observing
                        nurses as they interacted with the application prototypes. We paid close attention to their
                        workflows, pain points, and overall satisfaction with the design.</li>
                      <li><strong>Task-Based Testing:</strong> Participants were given specific tasks to complete within
                        the
                        application, such as searching for a patient or create their account.
                        This approach allowed for targeted feedback on key features and interactions.</li>
                      <li><strong>Think-Aloud Protocol:</strong> Users were encouraged to verbalize their thoughts and
                        actions as they navigated the application, providing valuable insights into their
                        decision-making
                        process and pain points.</li>
                      <li><strong>Post-Task Questionnaires:</strong> Participants were asked to complete questionnaires
                        following each task to rate their satisfaction, ease of use, and overall experience with the
                        application. This quantitative data complemented the qualitative feedback gathered during the
                        think-aloud sessions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Iterative Development Process:</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Feedback Analysis:</strong> The feedback gathered from user testing sessions was
                        analyzed
                        to identify common pain points, areas of confusion, and opportunities for improvement.</li>
                      <li><strong>Design Iterations:</strong> Based on the feedback analysis, design iterations were
                        implemented to address the identified issues and enhance the user experience.</li>
                      <li><strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> The revised prototypes were tested with new participants
                        to
                        validate the effectiveness of the design changes and gather additional feedback for further
                        refinement.</li>
                      <li><strong>Continuous Feedback Loop:</strong> The iterative development process involved multiple
                        rounds of testing, feedback, and refinement to ensure that the final application met user needs
                        and
                        expectations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Approach:</h2>
                    <p>We conducted usability testing with 5 nurses in a nursing home setting to evaluate the overall
                      app
                      usability. Through a combination of moderated usability tests and observational studies, we
                      identified
                      pain points that impacted user efficiency and data accuracy.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Findings Across the App:</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Inputs: </strong>Some interface elements were not intuitive, requiring additional
                        cognitive load.</li>
                      <li><strong>Data Entry:</strong> Data entry fields were not intuitive, leading to errors and
                        inefficiencies in patient record management.</li>
                      <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Alert messages were static, lacking actionable next steps.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Major Modification Focus: Patient Overview Page</h2>
                    <p>After testing the entire application, we found that the biggest usability issues appeared on the
                      "Patient Overview" page—a critical screen where nurses input and review patient data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Key Pain Points Identified in Patient Overview Page:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Pre-Filled Placeholder Text:</strong> Added example values in fields to guide users
                        and
                        improve speed.</li>
                      <li><strong>Measurement Units: </strong>Added mmHg, °C, % next to input fields to reduce
                        confusion.
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Actionable Alert Messages: </strong>Transformed static alerts into actionable messages
                        by
                        adding a "View Details" link to guide nurses to additional information.</li>

                    <p>This project was a transformative experience in designing a robust, user-friendly patient data
                      management system for healthcare providers. It reinforced the power of user-centered design,
                      iterative
                      development, and data-driven decision-making.</p>
                    <h2>Key Insights & Takeaways</h2>
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>User-Centric Design Drives Real Impact:</strong>
                        A user-centered, iterative design process was critical in ensuring the application aligned with
                        the
                        real-world needs of nurses, the primary users. Through continuous usability testing and feedback
                        loops, we:
                        ✔️ Refined workflows to match nurses’ daily routines seamlessly.
                        ✔️ Integrated input from other key stakeholders, including doctors and nutritionists, to ensure
                        a
                        holistic approach to patient care.
                        ✔️ Validated design decisions by observing nurses in their work environment, enabling us to make
                        informed improvements.
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Data-Driven Design Enhances Usability:</strong>
                        The testing methodology combined quantitative data (efficiency metrics, error rates, engagement
                        levels) with qualitative insights (direct nurse feedback, observational studies) to drive design
                        improvements.
                        ✔️ Metrics guided our priorities, ensuring the highest-impact changes were implemented.
                        ✔️ Real-world testing exposed usability gaps that traditional surveys missed.
                        ✔️ Final iterations demonstrated measurable impact, reducing data entry time by 51% and
                        minimizing
                        errors by 75%.
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Beyond Just Design – A Holistic Learning Experience:</strong>
                        This project was more than just a technical challenge—it was a learning journey that
                        strengthened
                        my
                        abilities in:
                        💡 UX/UI Strategy & Problem-Solving: Balancing user needs with business goals and technical
                        constraints.
                        💡 Secure Software Development: Ensuring patient data confidentiality while optimizing
                        usability.
                        💡 Cross-Functional Collaboration: Aligning designers, developers, and healthcare professionals
                        to
                        create a cohesive product.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                    <h2>🚀 Final Reflection</h2>
                    The Agartee Patient Data Management App is a testament to the power of collaborative, user-centered
                    design. Beyond delivering a functional product, this experience deepened my expertise in UX/UI
                    research,
                    usability testing, and iterative design.

                    I’m proud of the impact we achieved, and this project has further solidified my approach to
                    designing
                    products that are not only visually appealing but also highly intuitive and effective in real-world
                    use.
